 *
 * Weston extension to instruct the compositor to avoid any import
 * of the dmabuf created by 'linux-dmabuf' protocol other than the display
 * controller.
 *
 * Compositors are already going to use direct scan-out as much as possible but
 * there's no assurance that while doing so, they won't first import the dmabuf
 * in to the GPU. This extension assures the client that the compositor will
 * never attempt to import in to the GPU and pass it directly to the display
 * controller.
 *
 * Clients can make use of this extension to pass the dmabuf buffer to the
 * display controller, potentially increasing the performance and lowering the
 * bandwidth usage.
 *
 * Lastly, clients can make use of this extension in tandem with content-protection
 * one thus avoiding any GPU interaction and providing a secure-content path.
 * Also, in some cases, the memory where dmabuf are allocated are in specially
 * crafted memory zone which would be seen as an illegal memory access when the
 * GPU will attempt to read it.
 *
 * WARNING: This interface by design might break screenshoting functionality
 * as compositing might be involved while doing that. Also, do note, that in
 * case the dmabufer provided can't be imported by KMS, the client connection
 * will be terminated.
 *
 * WARNING: This extension requires 'linux-dmabuf' protocol and
 * 'zwp_linux_buffer_params_v1' be already created by 'zwp_linux_buffer_v1'.
