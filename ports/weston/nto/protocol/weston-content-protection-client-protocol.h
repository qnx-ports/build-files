/**
 * @page page_weston_content_protection The weston_content_protection protocol
 * Protocol for providing secure output
 *
 * @section page_desc_weston_content_protection Description
 *
 * This protocol specifies a set of interfaces used to provide
 * content-protection for e.g. HDCP, and protect surface contents on the
 * secured outputs and prevent from appearing in screenshots or from being
 * visible on non-secure outputs.
 *
 * A secure-output is defined as an output that is secured by some
 * content-protection mechanism e.g. HDCP, and meets at least the minimum
 * required content-protection level requested by a client.
 *
 * The term content-protection is defined in terms of HDCP type 0 and
 * HDCP type 1, but this may be extended in future.
 *
 * This protocol is not intended for implementing Digital Rights Management on
 * general (e.g. Desktop) systems, and would only be useful for closed systems.
 * As the server is the one responsible for implementing
 * the content-protection, the client can only trust the content-protection as
 * much they can trust the server.
 *
 * In order to protect the content and prevent surface contents from appearing
 * in screenshots or from being visible on non-secure outputs, a client must
 * first bind the global interface "weston_content_protection" which, if a
 * compositor supports secure output, is exposed by the registry.
 * Using the bound global object, the client uses the "get_protection" request
 * to instantiate an interface extension for a wl_surface object.
 * This extended interface will then allow surfaces to request for
 * content-protection, and also to censor the visibility of the surface on
 * non-secure outputs. Client applications should not wait for the protection
 * to change, as it might never change in case the content-protection cannot be
 * achieved. Alternatively, clients can use a timeout and start showing the
 * content in lower quality.
 *
 * Censored visibility is defined as the compositor censoring the protected
 * content on non-secure outputs. Censoring may include artificially reducing
 * image quality or replacing the protected content completely with
 * placeholder graphics.
 *
 * Censored visibility is controlled by protection mode, set by the client.
 * In "relax" mode, the compositor may show protected content on non-secure
 * outputs. It will be up to the client to adapt to secure and non-secure
 * presentation. In "enforce" mode, the compositor will censor the parts of
 * protected content that would otherwise show on non-secure outputs.

 *
 * A client can also request that its content only be displayed on outputs
 * that are considered secure. The 'enforce/relax' requests can achieve this.
 * In enforce mode, the content is censored for non-secure outputs.
 * The implementation of censored-visibility is compositor-defined.
 * In relax mode there are no such limitation. On an attempt to show the
 * client on unsecured output, compositor would keep on showing the content
 * and send the 'status' event to the client. Client can take a call to
 * downgrade the content.
 *
